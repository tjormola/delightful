# Delightful widgets for Awesome

This is Delightful, a set of widgets for [Awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org)
3.5 window manager.

Delightful home page is at
<http://solitudo.net/software/awesome/delightful/>. Also Delightful page at
[Awesome wiki](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/) is available at
<https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Delightful>. Screenshots showing Delightful
in action are available at <https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Glossy_theme>
and <https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Darklooks_theme>.

## Why?

Why another widget system for Awesome, you ask? We already have
[Vicious](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Vicious),
[Wicked](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Wicked),
[Obvious](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Obvious),
and [many others](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Category:Widgets).

## Justifications

That is a valid question, let me try elaborating why Delightful was created.

### Shiny colors

Your average Awesome widget is quite dull. Some might consider that a feature.
In this case, Delightful is probably not for you. Delightful try to add some
"bling" to the widgets. Not un-needed "bling" but something useful. Many
Delightful widgets provide a dynamically updated icon along with the widget
text. The icon might indicate the sound volume or battery level. Some of the
widgets use [Naughty](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Naughty) based pop-ups
and notifications to provide useful, additional information that doesn't fit
the Awesome wibox. Tooltips are used always when it makes sense.

You might find Delightful widgets to have resemblance to some of the old
GNOME 2 applets. This is not coincidental. Whether you find it a good or bad
thing is up to you.

### Configurable

Delightful widgets are also very configurable outside of the widget code.
Besides usual configurable attributes, such as location where to display
weather information or which network devices to exclude from monitoring, you
also can tinker about every widget parameter, such as the widget update
interval, from your Awesome `rc.lua` without having to edit the widget code.
See the configuration section below for more information about configuring
Delightful widgets and the themeing section about changing widget's appearance.

Important note! In order to maintain speedy startup, you have to alter the
theme you're using when using Delightful widgets with icons. See the themeing
section below for more info.

### Leveraging existing functionality

Delightful doesn't try to re-invent the wheel. Widgets depend heavily on
[Vicious](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Vicious) widget library.
A few of the widgets just extend an existing Vicious widget by providing
an icon and widget data display configuration for the Vicious widget
used under the hood. Some of the widgets provide features not available
in existing Vicious widgets by implementing the Vicious widget interface and
then add "the bling" on top of that.

# Included widgets

Delightful features the following widgets.

## Battery widget

`delightful.widget.battery` shows a battery indicator as an icon and a progress
bar. Extends `vicious.widgets.bat` Vicious widget.

## CPU widget

`delightful.widget.cpu` displays horizontal usage trend graph of all the CPUs
combined. Extends `vicious.widgets.cpu` Vicious widget.

## Date and time widget

Shows current date and time. When mouse cursor hovers over the widget, calendar
is displayed as a popup. You can navigate between months by using mouse scroll
wheel.

## IMAP widget

`delightful.widget.imap` monitors one or more IMAP accounts for incoming
messages. Multiple mailboxes can be monitored on each account. Number of unread
messages in each monitored mailbox is displayed in the widget. When new mail
arrives in one of the monitored mailboxes, some details about the message is
shown in a popup.  When mouse cursor hovers over the widget, details about each
mailbox is shown in a popup. Widget icon indicates the status whether there are
some unread mail in the monitored mailboxes. The IMAP widget implements
the Vicious widget interface.

## Memory widget

`delightful.widget.memory` displays a progress bar indicating current memory
and swap usage. Extends `vicious.widgets.mem` Vicious widget.

## Network widget

`delightful.widget.network` displays download and upload speeds of selected network
devices of the system. An icon indicates the type of the device (wired,
wireless or dialup). Extends `vicious.widgets.net` Vicious widget.


## PulseAudio widget

`delightful.widget.pulseaudio` shows a PulseAudio mixer indicator as an icon
and a progress bar. Mouse clicks and scroll wheel actions can used to perform
various mixer-related functions such as muting the device and turn volume up
and down. PulseAudio widget implements the Vicious widget interface.

## Weather widget

`delightful.widget.weather` monitors weather status of given locations. Widget
displays current temperature and an icon indicating the current weather
condition. Icon is updated dynamically according to the weather and time
changes. If the weather is clear, the icon indicates whether it's day or night
in the monitored location. When mouse cursor hovers over the widget, details
about the weather is shown in a popup. Weather widget implements the Vicious
widget interface.

# Dependencies

All widgets except the Date and time widget require
[Vicious](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Vicious). A tested and
found-to-be-working version of Vicious is provided in under the
`submodules/vicious` directory of the Delightful Git tree. See the downloading
and install sections below for more information about the bundled Vicious.
Using your existing Vicious installation or manually cloning the latest Vicious
sources from the [Git tree](http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/) will most likely
work, too.

All widgets except the Date and time widget require
[awesome-freedesktop](https://github.com/terceiro/awesome-freedesktop) for
icon support. A tested and found-to-be-working version of awesome-freedesktop
is provided in under the `submodules/awesome-freedesktop` directory of
the Delightful Git tree. See the downloading and install sections below for
more information about the bundled awesome-freedesktop. Using your existing awesome-freedesktop
installation or manually cloning the latest awesome-freedesktop sources from the
[Git tree](https://github.com/terceiro/awesome-freedesktop.git) will most
likely work, too.

All widgets except the Date and time widget can use icons. Using of icons is not
required, but highly recommended. See the section about themeing for more info.
On Debian/Ubuntu systems you can install the packages
`gnome-icon-theme gnome-icon-theme-full adwaita-icon-theme-full` in order
to get the common icons installed and additionally the package `sensors-applet`
if you're planning to use the CPU or Memory widgets and the packages
`libmateweather-common` if you're planning to use the Weather widget.

IMAP widget requires [`imap.lua`](https://github.com/dmj/misc/tree/master/lua/imap.lua).
A tested and found-to-be-working version of `imap.lua` is provided in under
the `submodules/imap` directory of the Delightful Git tree. See the downloading
and install sections below for more information about the bundled `imap.lua`.
`imap.lua` requires [LuaSocket](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~diego/professional/luasocket/)
and [LuaSec](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~brunoos/luasec/). On Debian/Ubuntu systems you
can install the packages `lua-socket` and `lua-sec` in order to get
LuaSocket and LuaSec installed.

Weather widget requires [Lua weather library](http://solitudo.net/software/lua/weatherlib/)
and [Lua METAR parser](http://solitudo.net/software/lua/metar/). A tested and
found-to-be-working versions of these modules are provided under
the `submodules/weatherlib` and `submodules/metar` directories of the Delightful
Git tree. See the downloading and install sections below for more information
about these modules. The METAR parser requires
[LuaSocket](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~diego/professional/luasocket/).
On Debian/Ubuntu systems you can install the package `lua-socket`
in order to get LuaSocket installed.

Weather widget can also use MateWeather XML location datafile to configure weather
report locations using city names instead of weather station code. See the
configuring section below for more information. If using this feature, also
[LuaExpat](http://www.keplerproject.org/luaexpat/) and
[lua\_zlip](https://github.com/brimworks/lua-zlib) need to be installed. On
Debian/Ubuntu systems you can install the packages
`libmateweather-common lua-expat lua-zlib` in order to get MateWeather XML
location datafile and required Lua libraries installed. Using MateWeather
support is highly recommended.

Calendar widget requires [`calendar2.lua`](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Calendar_widget#Module_for_3.4).
The module is included in this distribution. See the install section below for
more information.

# Configuration

This section documents the commonly used configuration options for each widget.
For full list of available configuration options for each widget, see
the comments at top of the each widget's source file under the directory
`delightful/widgets`.

Configuration options are defined as Lua tables with keys being the
configuration option name listed below and value being the configuration value.
See the section about using in Awesome for info on how to actually pass
the configuration to the widgets. 

## Battery widget

* `battery`
	* Battery name under the directory `/sys/class/power_supply/`. Defaults to `BAT1`. You probably don't have to change this.

## CPU widget

Default configuration should work for most people.

## Date and time widget

No configuration options available at all.

## IMAP widget

You can configure multiple IMAP accounts to be monitored for messages. Each
account can monitor multiple mailboxes. Each account needs to be given as a Lua
table entry. For each account entry the most interesting configuration options
are the following.

* `user`
	* User name of the IMAP account, mandatory
* `password`
	* Password of the IMAP account, mandatory
* `host`
	* Host name or IP address of the IMAP server, mandatory
* `port`
	* Port of the IMAP server. 143 by default if SSL disabled, 993 if SSL enabled
* `ssl`
	* `true` or `false` to enable or disable SSL for the IMAP connection. Note that only IMAPS is supported, not IMAP with STARTTLS. No SSL support by default.
* `mailboxes`
	* A table defining which mailboxes to monitor. Defaults to `INBOX` so not needed to be defined is you only want to monitor the inbox.

## Memory widget

Default configuration should work for most people.

## Network widget

Default configuration should work for most people. But if the widget displays
status for unwanted network devices, the following configuration option is
handy.

* `excluded_devices`
	* A table of [Lua patterns](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1) that match network devices that are not to be monitored. For instance, if you don't want to see the idle interface `eth1`, you could use the pattern `^eth1$`.

## PulseAudio widget

Default configuration should work for most people. But if the widget displays
volume mixer for unwanted audio devices, the following configuration option is
handy.

* `sink_nums`
	* A table of integers that reprsents the PulseAudio sink numbers to be used. To find out the sink number(s) you want to use, run command `pacmd list-sinks` and examine the output. Each line with the content `* index: <number>` shows a possible sink number that you can use in the `sink_nums` configuration option.


## Weather widget

It is assumed that MateWeather XML location datafile is available. See the source
file `delightful/widgets/weather.lua` for more information about configuration
if you're not going to be using MateWeather XML location datafile support.

You can configure multiple locations for weather monitoring. Each location
needs to be given as a Lua table entry. For each location entry the most
interesting configuration options are the following.

* `city`
	* The city and optional country to monitor as listed in the MateWeather XML location datafile. The format for full entry is `<country name>, <city name>`, for example `United Kingdom, London`. For London, UK, you have to use the full format since the MateWeather XML location datafile contains many cities named `London` and the first matching city is used. If the city name is globally unique, it's safe to use the simple format `<city name>`. For example, to monitor the capital of Finland, you can just use `Helsinki` as there's no two cities named `Helsinki` in the world.

This is really all that is needed if you're happy to use European style units.
If you want to display units commonly used in the US or elsewhere, you can
additionally use the following configuration options.

* `temperature_unit`
	* The unit to use when displaying temperatures. Defaults to `c` for Celcius, other possible value is `f` for Fahrenheit.
* `wind_speed_unit`
	* The unit to use when displaying wind speed. Defaults to `ms` for meters per second, other possible values are `kmh` for kilometers per hour, `mph` for miles per hour and `kn` for knots.
* `pressure_unit`
	* The unit to use when displaying air pressure. Defaults to `hpa` for hectopascals, other possible values are `atm` for standard atmosphere and `inhg` for inches of Mercury.
* `visibility_unit`
	* The unit to use when visibility distance. Defaults to `m` for meters, other possible values are `km` kilometers, `ft` for feet, `yd` for yards and `mi` for miles.

## Configuration options common to all widgets

Well, all but the Date and time widget.

* `update_interval`
	* How often the widget data is being updated. Default varies for each widget from CPU widget's one second to Weather widget's 20 minutes. Most likely the default is OK for each widget.
* `no_icon`
	* `true` or `false` to disable or enable showing of widget icons. Default is to show icons for all widgets.

# Themeing

Delightful widgets can use various aspects of the current
[Beautiful](https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Beautiful) theme, though
Delightful widgets should work with any unmodified theme. However, when using
unmodified themes, be aware of the default icon lookup related performance
notes below.

See the themes at [my Awesome themes page](http://solitudo.net/software/awesome/themes/)
for examples of themes with full Delightful support.

## Icons

All widgets except the Date and time widget use various icons. 
For full list of available themable icons for each widget, see
the comments at top of the each widget's source file under the directory
`delightful/widgets`.

While icons are highly recommended, they are not mandatory. You can disable
showing of icons by two means. Either for each widget, set the `no_icon`
configuration option explained above to `true` or just don't install the
packages providing the default icons that are tried to lookup. The `no_icon`
way is recommended since this way you don't get the performance penalty with
the default icon lookup.

## Text color

Battery, CPU, Memory, and PulseAudio widgets can use the following colors
defined in the theme to color bars, graphs, and text.

* `bg_widget`
	* Widget background and border color, fallback to color `bg_normal` if `bg_widget` not defined
* `fg_widget`
	* Widget foreground color, fallback to color `fg_normal` if `fg_widget` not defined
* `fg_center_widget`
	* Middle part of the widget gradient color, fallback to color `fg_widget` and `fg_normal` if `fg_center_widget` not defined
* `fg_end_widget`
	* End part of the widget gradient color, fallback to color `fg_widget` and `fg_normal` if `fg_end_widget` not defined

## Font

IMAP and Weather widgets use the following font.

* `delightful_monospace_font`
	* Font used when rendering text to popups. The setting should refer to a [monospaced font](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font). Fallback to `monospace` if `delightful_monospace_font` not defined.

# Using in Awesome

This section shows what you need to add to your Awesome configuration in order
to get Delightful widgets added to your Awesome desktop. In this sample,
default configuration for Awesome 3.5.6 as shipped in Ubuntu 15.10 wily is
used. I'm sure you can apply this to newer default configurations or integrate
as part of your non-default configuration. Of course put something meaningful
in the IMAP widget configuration, remove unwanted widgets and so on.

In `rc.lua`, add the following section somewhere before the for loop that
iterates over each screen and sets up a wibox for the screen.

---

	-- Delightful widgets
	require('delightful.widgets.battery')
	require('delightful.widgets.cpu')
	require('delightful.widgets.datetime')
	require('delightful.widgets.imap')
	require('delightful.widgets.memory')
	require('delightful.widgets.network')
	require('delightful.widgets.pulseaudio')
	require('delightful.widgets.weather')

	-- Which widgets to install?
	-- This is the order the widgets appear in the wibox.
	delightful_widgets = {
	    delightful.widgets.network,
	    delightful.widgets.cpu,
	    delightful.widgets.memory,
	    delightful.widgets.weather,
	    delightful.widgets.imap,
	    delightful.widgets.battery,
	    delightful.widgets.pulseaudio,
	    delightful.widgets.datetime,
	}

	-- Widget configuration
	delightful_config = {
	    [delightful.widgets.cpu] = {
	        command = 'gnome-system-monitor',
	    },
	    [delightful.widgets.imap] = {
	        {
	            user      = 'myuser',
	            password  = 'mypassword',
	            host      = 'mail.example.com',
	            ssl       = true,
	            mailboxes = { 'INBOX', 'awesome' },
	            command   = 'evolution -c mail',
	        },
	    },
	    [delightful.widgets.memory] = {
	        command = 'gnome-system-monitor',
	    },
	    [delightful.widgets.weather] = {
	        {
	            city = 'Helsinki',
	            command = 'gnome-www-browser http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/saa/Helsinki',
	        },
	    },
	    [delightful.widgets.pulseaudio] = {
	        mixer_command = 'pavucontrol',
	    },
	}

---

Then inside the wibox creating for loop, delete the lines

---

	if s == 1 then right_layout:add(wibox.widget.systray()) end
	right_layout:add(mytextclock)

---

and replace with

---

	if s == 1 then
	    right_layout:add(wibox.widget.systray())
	    delightful.utils.fill_wibox_container(delightful_widgets, delightful_config, right_layout)
	end

---

and you should be done.

This sample Delightful setup is also available as a patch file
`awesome-3.5.6-delightful-sample-configuration.diff` in the Delightful
distribution. The patch is against the stock Awesome 3.5.6 `rc.lua`.
